<h1>BitLotto's Official Lottery Pools</h1>

<p>
Joining a lottery pool increases your chances of winning greatly as long as you are willing to share the winnings with 
others. The larger the pool, the greater the odds of winning. <b>Only use BitLotto Compatible software</b>
to make payments to these pools and back up your wallets! Entries after the draw deadline will be returned. 

<br><br>
BitLotto operates TWO main pools:<br><br>
</p>

<hr>
<h1>BitLotto's Pirate Pool</h1>
<p>
<b>Payment to: 1JB9x5vGf37hMcQe7Ke4dU1PEq7k6T45yK (Oct 5)</b><br>
<b>This pool accepts ANY size payment of 0.1 BTC or above!</b><br>
This pool will pay out based on the percentage of the contributions! At the end of the 
draw, BitLotto will contribute just enough to make it an even multiple of 0.25.<br>
NOTE: There is no need to make multiple small payments. Just pay the total you want to contribute. 

<br><br>

<hr>

<h1>BitLotto's Stranger Pool</h1>
<p>
<b>Send multiples of 0.25 to: 1ENjVYVK38aNo1gDiirrcexmT5oq1fmyD (Oct 5)</b><br>
Each 0.25 multiple will have 10% of the jackpot!!<br>
<b>This pool only accepts multiples of 0.25 BTC.</b> Each group of 10 tickets sorted by block number will share the winnings. 
(smallest block number is 1) If multiple tickets show
up in one block they are sorted 0-9, a-f in that block to decide the sequence.
Any remainder will form a smaller group. (Even a rare case of a lone stranger)<br>
<b>Any payment smaller than 0.25 will be ignored and not part of the pool! Any extra change will also be ignored.</b>
<br>
NOTE: Making a large payment at one time means those tickets will likely be in the same group. Paying some,
then waiting for others to pay, ensures you are included in multiple groups. A payment of 2.5 BTC could 
potentially contain only one person. (They will just get the whole jackpot in this case.)

</p>
<hr>
<h1>How the hashes are done for pools</h1>
<p>
Official pools run by BitLotto will ONLY use the first valid payment tx hash to the pool address. 
If the first block in which a pool 
transaction appears has more than one payment transaction, then the transaction being first will 
be the first payment transaction hash in that block after sorting all the payment transactions: 0-9, a-f.
The pools total funds are calculated and the hashes are generated just like what would happen if someone
made a large payment in the main BitLotto draw address. 
<p/>


<h1>Feel free to make your own pool amongst friends!</h1>
<p>It's a great way to improve your odds of winning!</p>
