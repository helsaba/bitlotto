<h1>Complete Details:</h1>
<p>To play BitLotto you must be paying with a method where you are the owner of the private key used for sending
the BTC. Unless you are using a shared (online) wallet this is usually the case. The list of compatible software
for playing BitLotto is listed on BitLotto's main page. BitLotto works by sending the winnings to same Bitcoin
address that send the payment. If multiple people are sharing a wallet then the winnings will go to the wrong person. 
<strong>BitLotto has decided to run the lottery in this fashion because it allows for more transparency of 
the lottery as all plays are known by everyone and can't be manipulated by anyone.</strong> Not even 
BitLotto can fake who wins or fake payments. Using the Bitcoin blockchain it can be proven
that the correct winner got the winnings sent to them! If you use an online wallet, send some BTC to BitLotto
compatible softare and then buy the tickets there. If you win, the BTC will be send there. 
<br><br>To play: send BTC to the Bitcoin address used for the desired draw.
Each months draw will have a different Bitcoin address. Price per 
play could change as the value of Bitcoins change. 
<br><br>Each payment will then have a corresponding transaction hash that is available everywhere in 
the Bitcoin network as proof of purchase. This hash creates your tickets. Every one is unique and can't be changed because
it's contained in the Bitcoin blockchain and permanently set. 
Your first ticket will be the transaction hash of the payment to the BitLotto draw address. 
Each multiple over the ticket price will use the original transaction hash with an added a number (starting at 1) at the 
end of the transaction hash and re-hashed to create the other tickets. 
Example: The second ticket would be SHA256(originalhash1) and the third ticket would be SHA256(originalhash2).
Entries have to be received in a Bitcoin block the day before the draw. (Deadline is before the first block after 00:00:00 UTC Date of Draw) Waiting
till just before the time limit increases your chance the entry won't get received on time. 
Better to be safe than sorry and send it days before the draw. If you have waited till the last minute and still want to enter the draw, just
configure your Bitcoin client to pay a small transaction fee. 
That should make sure it gets in the Bitcoin network as soon as possible. Entries received after 
Thursday will be returned minus 0.01 for services and to cover transaction fees. 
<br><br>The winner will be determined by using SHA256 hashes. This will ensure
that no one, not even BitLotto, can manipulate who wins. 
The mixer hash is a SHA256 hash of: luckyblockhash+lotterynumbers (no spaces or + sign)
Lucky Block hash is the hash of the first Bitcoin block in the Bitcoin network with a 
timestamp after 00:00:00 UTC (On date of the draw). The lottery numbers come from the Mega Millions drawn Friday night local time. 
A draw of: 07,19,39,41,55 (low to high) Mega Ball 21 would be entered as: 071939415521 in the formula.

This method makes it impossible for anyone, even BitLotto, to manipulate who wins. And since the ticket hashes are publicly
known, along with who sent it, it's impossible for BitLotto to fake a payment to a wrong person.  
<br><br>
To determine the winner each transaction hash will have the mixer hash added to the end. This
string is now hashed again using SHA256. Hashes created from official
BitLotto pools will also be added. The resulting hashes are sorted 0-9,a-f and what ever
hash is sorted to the beginning wins. (Will likely start with multiple 0's)


<br><br>After the draw is done the winner's account along with the transaction hash 
will be announced and posted online. This will allow 
others to compare their hash with the winner to verify that the person 
is indeed the winner. After a few days 99% of the
funds will go to whatever account sent the winning Bitcoin transaction hash.
<br><br>The winner is not required to 
contact BitLotto. The money will just show up in their account!
<br><br><strong>Why keep 1%?</strong><br><br>One
percent is <strong>extremely low for lotteries</strong>! With many lotteries up to half 
of the money is put into other projects or donated. BitLotto encourages 
winners to donate some of the winnings but it is up to the winner to 
choose what to do with their winnings. The <strong>1% margin helps keep BitLotto
honest</strong>. If someone were to create an alternate lottery with no profit 
kept it could be conceived that such individual could create the lottery
for the sole purpose of becoming popular only to never pay the winnings
out one day when the funds get really big and just disappear with the 
money. Even though 1% is low <strong>it's in BitLotto's long term interest to 
develop trust with time and always pay the winner</strong>. It would only take 
one time of not paying before all trust is lost. By building trust and 
doing as specified it is hoped that BitLotto becomes very popular and by
doing that, helps generate some profit from the 1% stake. Long term, 
it's better to follow the rules than one month decide to keep the money.
BitLotto will make more money by giving out the winnings consistently 
every month so the service becomes bigger and bigger. With no 1% stake 
there would be the temptation for someone to keep the funds. With the 1%
stake it's better to keep awarding the prize to the proper person each 
month as promised as in the long term BitLotto will be more successful!<br><br>Because
the BitLotto account is known all money involved can be verified and 
monitored by anyone. All hashes are known before the draw and the 
numbers come from a source beyond BitLotto's control. Because of the way it's set up 
it's very hard to scam or rip people off. Anyone can verify everything, 
even if the winnings were sent to the right person!
<br><br>
In the event of a discrepancy between the details in another language and English, the English rules will be followed.
